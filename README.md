========
FIU-Miner is a Fast, Integrated, and User-friendly system to ease data analysis. 
FIU-Miner allows users to rapidly configure a complex data analysis task without writing a single line of code. 
It also helps users conveniently import and integrate different analysis programs. 
Further, it significantly balances resource utilization and task execution in heterogeneous environments.
The details of FIU-Miner is available at the KDD 2013 demo paper - [FIU-Miner: a Fast, Integrated, and User-friendly system for data mining in distributed environment](http://users.cs.fiu.edu/~yjian004/paper/kdd-2013-fiuminer.pdf).
